# Text Mining with Naive Bayes algorithm
This repository contains a project of text mining with basically 3 steps:
	- Pre-process a text corpus (PreProcessing file)
	- Creation of a Bag-of-Words (Analysis file)
	- Classification using Naive Bayes algorithm (NaiveBayesTextMining file)

The text corpus is composed by scienfic articles related with 3 different topics:
	- CBR: Case-Based Reasoning 
	- ILP: Indutive Logical Programming
	- IR: Information Retrival

# Execution
To execute this project you have to open the ".ipynb" files with "Jupyter-Notebook"

I strongly recommend that you install jupyter-notebook with the package "Anaconda", following the steps provided by the link below:
